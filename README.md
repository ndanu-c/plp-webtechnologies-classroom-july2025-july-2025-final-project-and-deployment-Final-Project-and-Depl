# 📦 Women Empowering Site  

In a world where women are often left behind, I decided to put my front-end skills to work and create a site where women's achievements are seen, celebrated, and appreciated. This site will continue to evolve as I add more inspiring stories and features.

## 🌐🎯 Part 1: Planning and Organizing a Multipage Website  
Before writing any code, I took time to plan:  

- **Purpose**: Showcase women’s successes.  
- **Pages**:  
  - `index.html` → Home  
  - `success.html` → Success Stories  
- **Goal**: To build an intentional structure and user journey across the site.

## 🌍💻 Part 2: Building the Website (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript)  

I used modern frontend tools to bring the project to life:  

- **HTML5** → Semantic structure for accessibility and clarity.  
- **CSS** → Responsive layouts, animations, and consistent styling.  
- **JavaScript** → Interactivity (menus, forms, toggles, and dynamic content).  

### Each page includes:  
- Mobile responsiveness 📱  
- Consistent layout, header, and footer 🎨  
- At least one interactive element ⚡ (e.g., hover animations, back button, or dynamic menu).

## 🛠️🚀 Part 3: Best Practices for Code Organization  

Before deployment, I refactored the project to follow **production-ready practices**:  

- Organized files into folders (`/css`, `/js`, `/images`)  
- Clean, modular, and commented code ✍️  
- Meaningful file names and relative paths 📂  
- Validated HTML/CSS and tested on different screen sizes 📐

## 🌐🚀 Part 4: Hosting and Deployment
